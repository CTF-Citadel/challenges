# Dan's vacation

> [!NOTE]
> I wanted to create easy challenge to begin the OSINT Part of the CTF. I started by finding a racetrack where i can take a screenshot and the challenge is to use Reverse Image Search to find the track. 

## Challenge creation

I selected the Hungaroring because it looks like some other tracks and therefor the players don't have it to easy.

The screenshot is from a 360Â° camera of the racetrack from Google Earth.
