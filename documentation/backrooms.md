## Challenge creation

Step 1 Cutting:
We start by using the cutting option in Premiere:

The video needs to be cut into little pieces for the glitching:

Step 2 duplication: 
The cut pieces need to be duplicated:

Under the Opacity Filter, you need to turn down the opacity of the duplicate:

Because of the opacity and different position it looks like this:

For a better look we play around with the colour:

Step 3 VHS Effect:
We start by creating 3 copies of the original to add a colour filter:

Each of the copies gets on color set to "100":

Together with a overlay the result looks like this:
