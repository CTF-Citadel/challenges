## Challenge creation

First I chose a flag for the challenge and put it into a morse code translator:

Next I created a BMP image in paint to then render it in CoagulaLight:

First we need to import the file into CoagulaLight:

Under the "Sound" tab we need to use the "Render Without Blue" option:

Then we just save the file:

Now we have the wav file ready for the challenge


In Audacity it should look like this:
