# StormCast 1

## Description
```
I have obtained a prototype of the new authentication app for the StormCast Messenger. 
My contact on the inside told me that they are using an advanced security code system called SEC_CODE. 
If we want to get the backup code, we need to find a way to tamper with the SEC_CODE system to get the backup codes.
