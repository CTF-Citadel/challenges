# StormCast 1

I have obtained a prototype of the new authentication app for the StormCast Messenger inlcuding some bit's of the source code. 
My contact on the inside told me that they are using an advanced security code system called SEC_CODE. 
If we want to get the backup code, we need to find a way to tamper with the SEC_CODE system to get the backup codes.

## Task

Find a way to get the SEC_CODE and the backup codes.

## Solution

Take a look at the retrieved source code
