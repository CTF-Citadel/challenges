# Happy Ending

A friend of mine went missing, this here is the last picture he sent me before his phone died.
Can you help me find his location.

--> Now we have a vague clue where he is

My first idea is to triangulate the position:

Now we add a few radius of cities and we have a idea where he is:

If we zoom in we find the region he was last seen in:
