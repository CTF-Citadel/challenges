# Happy Ending

A friend of mine went missing, this here were the last pictures he sent me before his phone died.
Can you help me find the location/region of the 2 images.


Flag:{Hint1_Hint2}

This is the Hint1 picture he sent me:

--> Now we have a vague clue where he is

My first idea is to triangulate the position:

Now we add a few radius of cities and we have a idea where he is:

If we zoom in we find the region he was last seen in:

We found the for the Hint1 location!

This is the Hint2 picture he sent me:

After a quick reverse image search we find the location of the Hint2:
