# layered Walkthrough

## Introduction

The only thing we have is the file called "layermethisbatman.xcf." From the file extension ".xcf," we can already tell it's a GIMP file. So, open it in GIMP, or Photoshop works as well.


After opening the file, we get this view:

The first thing we notice is that the file has a lot of layers. By clicking on the "eye button," we can look through the layers:

After checking out all the layers, we notice parts of what look like a QR code hidden inside.

So now all we have to do is take out the parts, combine them into one QR code, and scan it.

And we get the flag
