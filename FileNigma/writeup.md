# Introduction

"We've stumbled upon a zipped folder, and hidden within it lies the flag. Can you uncover its location?

Let's go ahead and download the folder. It's in .tar.gz format, so we need to unzip it first.

After unzipping it we find 100 .txt files

Since we are searching for the flag with the format 'TH{,' we can try to grep for it.
