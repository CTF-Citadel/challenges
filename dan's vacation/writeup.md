Flag:{Location_Country}

The only hint is the picture of a Race Track, so the only logical option is a reverse image search.

Now we have a few options to choose from:”Hungaroring, Red Bull Ring and Austin”

The next step is Google Maps, if we look on the satellite pictures of all those race tracks we see that only the “Hungaroring” has these markings.
