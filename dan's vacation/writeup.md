# Dan’s Vacation

Dan is a Cyber Security Expert, but at the moment he is on
vacation. The problem is we need him right now. Can you find
him?



Flag:{Location_Country}

The only hint is the picture of a Race Track, so the only logical option is a reverse image search.


Now we have a few options to choose from:”Hungaroring, Red Bull Ring and Austin”

The next step is Google Maps, if we look on the satellite pictures of all those race tracks we see that only the “Hungaroring” has these markings.



Now we can look at the track with Street View 


We found it!
